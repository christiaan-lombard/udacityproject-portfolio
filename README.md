## Udacity Project Specifications

You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

 - [Mockup](design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)
 - [HTML5 semantic (structural) elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

Be sure to follow the Project Rubric closely when designing your page. For example, note that HTML5 semantic (structural) elements must be used to organize content.

### Instructions

 - Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
 - Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
 - Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
 - Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
 - Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
 - HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
 - CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).

### Style Guidelines
#### CSS Guidelines
```
CSS - Use consistent indentation (tabs or spaces). (See: CSS General Formatting Rules-Indentation)
CSS - Selectors, properties and property values (with the exception of strings) should be lowercase, including letters in hexadecimal color values. For example #f06c13 instead of #F06C13 and #ccc rather than #CCC. (See: CSS-General Formatting Rules-Capitalization.)
CSS - Use IDs and class names that are meaningful or generic. (See: CSS-ID and Class Naming.)
CSS - Use ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary. (See: CSS-ID and Class Naming.)
CSS - Use Shorthand properties in all possible places for margin, border, padding, background. Examples: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties. (See: CSS Style Rules-Shorthand Properties.)
CSS - Indent block content between curly braces. (See: CSS Formatting Rules-Block Content Indentation.)
CSS - End all declarations with a semicolon. (See: CSS Formatting Rules-Declaration Stops.)
